    NOTE: I'm using CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/), a cleaner and       
    less syntactically-dense version of JavaScript, to generate the JavaScript   
    necessary to work with D3. I store my CoffeeScript in the `coffee` directory,
    and keep the compiled, human-readable JavaScript in the `js` directory.      
    Since it contains my comments and formatting, I strongly recommend looking   
    at my CoffeeScript code. Besides, it's very similar to the JavaScript I would
    otherwise write; if you know JavaScript, you know CoffeeScript. Thank you    
    for understanding.
